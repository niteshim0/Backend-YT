# YouTube-like App Backend

## Overview

Welcome to the backend repository for the YouTube-like app! This repository contains the server-side code and infrastructure needed to support the functionality of a video-sharing platform similar to YouTube. The backend is responsible for handling user authentication, managing video uploads, handling comments, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: The backend is built using Node.js to leverage its asynchronous and event-driven architecture.
- **Express.js**: Express is used as the web application framework to simplify the development of the API.
- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is chosen as the database to store user information, video metadata, comments, and other relevant data.
- **Mongoose**: Mongoose is an ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution to model application data.
